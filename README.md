Thank you for visiting my profile!<br>
I'm an aspiring full stack developer with interests in containerization, web security, and React application development. My main project right now is [Chainlink Finary](https://github.com/CODE-REFINARY/Chainlink-Finary), which currently serves as a documentation builder for my current job as well as a convenient opportunity for me to learn new web technology and frameworks. Other career-specific interests of mine include
* C# native application development and ElectronJS
* digital audio processing
* game development (unreal engine 4)
